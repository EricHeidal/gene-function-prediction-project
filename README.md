# geneFunctionPrediction

This was a project I worked on with a team for my Bioinformatics course. 

The goal was the prediction of gene function based on the Gene Ontology dataset. The binary classification would be made by examining an unknown gene's expression data compared to that of genes with known functions.

We did this by coding the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for SVM classification from scratch, along with K-Fold validation for training/testing and visualization of the ROC curve.
